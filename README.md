# PlainMusicPlayer
Personal project to develop a simple functional music player

This project is essentially meant to keep me busy during the lazy summer months,
my goal is to end up with a music player that can manage playlists initially, and
if I see that I can expand it easily, maybe add a few features on top of that.


##  Libraries / Software used
Here is a list of the libraries I am currently using or plan to use while 
developing this application.

#### FMOD
 For audio playback and channel management
        
#### TagLib
For extracting the id3 tags (if any are present) inside audio files.
        
#### Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
Started development in this IDE
        
#### Qt Creator
As soon as I was ready to start integrating the project into a 
GUI, I ported it to Qt Creator and kept working there.
