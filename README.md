# PlainMusicPlayer
Personal project to develop a simple functional music player

This project is essentially meant to keep me busy during the lazy summer months,
my goal is to end up with a music player that can manage playlists initially, and
if I see that I can expand it easily, maybe add a few features on top of that.


##  Libraries used
Here is a list of the libraries I am currently using or plan to use while 
developing this application.

#### FMOD
 For audio playback and channel management
        
#### TagLib
For extracting the id3 tags (if any are present) inside audio files.
        
#### JUCE (GUI only, possible)
I *really* don't want to deal with creating a GUI from scratch in Windows
