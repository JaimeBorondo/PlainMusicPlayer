# PlainMusicPlayer
Personal project to develop a simple functional music player

This project is essentially meant to keep me busy during the lazy summer months,
my goal is to end up with a music player that can manage playlists initially, and
if I see that I can expand it easily, maybe add a few features on top of that.

# Libraries used
###   FMOD
    For audio playback and channel management
    
###   id3lib
    For extracting the id3 tags (if any are present) inside audio files.
    
###   JUCE (GUI only)
    I *really* don't want to deal with creating a GUI from scratch in Windows
