# PlainMusicPlayer
Personal project to develop a simple functional music player

This project is essentially meant to keep me busy during the lazy summer months,
my goal is to end up with a music player that can manage playlists initially, and
if I see that I can expand it easily, maybe add a few features on top of that.
